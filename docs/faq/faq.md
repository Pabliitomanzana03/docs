  <p>
    
You might be hitting the quota limitation. Check your organization's quota
in Billing > See detailed insightsâ€¦ > Quota. More information about quota 
and how to ask for an increase here: 
https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/133-quotas-and-limits.

You may also run `sem get jobs` to display all running jobs 
so you may confirm how much quota is being used. 
More information about `sem get`: 
https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/53-sem-reference#sem-get-examples.

If the `bundle install` output looks like this:
```bash
Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/.......
Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/..
Updating git://github.com/some/gem.git
fatal: Could not parse object 'a84dd3407eaf064064cca9650c354cb163384467'.
Git error: command `git reset --hard a84dd3407eaf064064cca9650c354cb163384467` in directory /home/runner/somehash/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/bundler/gems/gem-a84dd3407eaf has failed.
If this error persists you could try removing the cache directory '/home/runner/somehash/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/cache/bundler/git/gem-cbe2ee16ed53098079007f06cd77ed0890d0d752'
```
    
This problem occurs when there have been changes like 
force-pushes to a git repo which is referenced in a Gemfile. 
You can solve it by following these steps:
- Comment that gem line in the Gemfile
- Run `bundle install`
- Uncomment the gem line in the Gemfile
- Run `bundle install` again

The Gemfile.lock will now reference a valid git revision.

  <summary id="how-to-change-the-timezone">How to change the timezone?</summary>
  <p>
    
The default timezone in the virtual machine is set to UTC. 
The timezone can be changed in 2 ways:

- Assign a different value to `TZ` environment variable: 
```
export TZ=Europe/Belgrade
```
- Create a symlink in `/etc/localtime` to one of the available timezones:
```
sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Belgrade /etc/localtime
```
  </p>

  <p>

- Add the following commands as a [prologue][]:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
- Add the following command as an [epilogue][]:
```
git submodule deinit --force .
```
Make sure that Semaphore has permissions to clone your submodules repository. 
In our [private dependencies][private-dependencies] page you can find more
information about setting permissions for private repositories.
